## Linear regression to predict MPG 
Vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD provide a signifanct non-random amount of variance to the mpg values of the data. Vehicle length and ground clearance both have P values below 0.05 and hence don't have a significant influence on the driven miles. The intercept is not statistically significant which means all the variables that can affect the mpg are included in our model i.e vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD. The P-value is much smaller than the assumed signifanct level of 0.05% which means we can safely reject our null hypothesis and the slope of our model is not 0. This linear model has a R value of 0.72 which means approximately 72% of all mpg of MechaCars prototypes predictions will be correct when using this linear model. That is a pretty good outcome of a statistical model.
